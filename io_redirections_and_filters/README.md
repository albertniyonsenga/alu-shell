# I/O Redirections and Filters

## Hello World and Smiley - 0&1
Where in this tasks we are required to print `Hello, World ` and `confused smiley`  and we simply used echo command.

## Displaying a file - 2
In this repository we used simple `cat` command to display content of our file `/etc/passwd`.

## What about 2 - 3
As we are required to display content of the two files at the same time while maintaing the rules of the task , we simply used `cat` and then parse the first file_name and then parse the second file_name. 

## Last lines of a file - 4
To display the last lines of a file we have to use `tail` and parse the `-n` which is amodern form to specify that we will be working with lines and then number of last line to look for and in our case is `10` and then file_name as last.

## Prefering First lines - 5
As different to task 4 here we just have to display the first lines and instead of using `tail` we used `head` and it works the same way for other parts.
